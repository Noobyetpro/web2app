# 🌐 web2app-cli

Turn any website into a standalone **Windows Electron desktop app** with a single command.

No complex boilerplate. Just pass a URL — and optionally an icon and app name — and get a `.exe` instantly. 🔥

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm i -g web2app-cli
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
web2app-cli <url> [--icon=path/to/icon.ico] [--name=AppName]
```

### ✅ Example

```bash
web2app-cli https://google.com --icon=icon.ico --name=GoogleApp
```

This command creates a folder like:
```
GoogleApp-win32-x64/
├── GoogleApp.exe     ← Your desktop app!
└── ...
```
DON'T DELETE THE DLL AND OTHER FILES/FOLDERS, they are required to run the application. Learn how to create an application setup file with[ Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
